# [Student Track] AI for Communities, Access and Public Impact

## 1. Problem Statement - AI-Based Crowd Density Prediction and Safe Route System

Large public gatherings in India such as religious events (for example, Kumbh Mela), festivals, political rallies, and crowded transport hubs often face very high crowd density. It is common in India to have such highly crowded places. In many situations, authorities and the public do not have real-time information about how crowded an area is. This lack of awareness can lead to overcrowding, panic situations, and sometimes stampedes.

Existing navigation systems such as Google Maps mainly focus on vehicle traffic and do not provide information about crowd movement in open public spaces. There is a need for a system that can monitor people’s movement, predict overcrowding, and help both authorities and the public make safer decisions.

## 2. Objectives

- Monitor crowd density in real time using location data  
- Predict areas that may become overcrowded  
- Provide safer route suggestions to users  
- Send early warnings to users  
- Improve public safety and reduce crowd-related risks such as stampedes and reduce the possible risk of loss of life due to poor crowd management at highly crowded places

## 3. Target Users / Stakeholders

- General public attending events  
- Event organizers  
- Police and disaster management teams

## 4. Why AI is Needed

Traditional systems such as Google Maps can only show the current crowd situation. They cannot predict future crowd buildup.

AI is required to:

- Use past data or stored historical data  
- Analyze large amounts of location data  
- Identify crowd movement patterns over time  
- Predict areas that may become overcrowded on the basis of past data  
- Enable early action before the situation becomes dangerous and suggest safer routes generated by AI  

This allows authorities and users to take preventive measures instead of reacting after overcrowding has already occurred.

## 5. Functional Requirements

- Collect GPS location data from users’ phones with consent  
- Store and process location data in real time  
- Estimate crowd density for different areas  
- Analyze past and real-time data to identify movement patterns  
- Predict potential overcrowding zones using AI  
- Identify high-risk areas and generate alerts  
- Suggest safer alternative routes to users  
- Provide a dashboard or map view showing crowd density  
- Represent crowd density using a color-coded map, where areas with higher crowd concentration are shown in red and lower-density areas in lighter colors

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- User privacy must be protected (no personal identity stored)  
- Location sharing should be based on user consent  
- System should support large numbers of users (scalable)  
- Data processing should be near real time  
- System should be reliable and available during large events  

---

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

- Users have smartphones with GPS enabled  
- Internet connectivity is available  
- Enough users share location data to estimate crowd density accurately  
- GPS accuracy is within acceptable limits
